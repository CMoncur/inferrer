## Installation
`npm install inferrer --save`

## Using inferrer
First, require the module:
`const Inferrer = require("inferrer")`

Or using the `import` spec:
`import Inferrer from "inferrer"`

### Basic Usage Example
Instantiate a new SVM, and train the SVM using training examples that can be classified in a binary fashion:
```javascript
// The options passed to the SVM class are optional. Details below.
const XOR = new Inferrer({ kernel: "gaussian", gamma: 2 })

XOR.train([
  { input: [ 0, 0 ], classification: -1 },
  { input: [ 0, 1 ], classification: 1 },
  { input: [ 1, 0 ], classification: 1 },
  { input: [ 1, 1 ], classification: -1 }
])
```

It's important to note that all training/testing inputs _must_ be lists of the same length, and every training input _must_ have a classification thereunto pertaining.

Once the SVM is trained, classifying test inputs is accomplished thusly, using the `classify` method:
```javascript
XOR.classify([ 0, 1 ])
// => 1
```
```javascript
XOR.classify([ 0, 0 ])
// => -1
```

The `classifyList` method can be used to classify a list of test values:
```javascript
XOR.classifyList([ [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 1 ] ])
// => [ -1, 1, 1, -1 ]
```

The hyperplane/offset that results from the training inputs can be accessed using the following methods, respectively:
```javascript
XOR.hyperplane()
```
```javascript
XOR.offset()
```

### Options
- `kernel`: The _type_ of SVM to be used. Defaults to `linear`.
  - `linear`: Best for data that is _linearly separable_.
  - `gaussian`: Best for noisy or oddly formed datasets.
- `c`: "Strictness" of the SVM. Larger values create a stricter hyperplane. If data is noisy, it may be best to drop the value of `c` to create a hyperplane that best classifies the dataset. Defaults to `3`

### Advanced Options
- `tolerance`: Tolerance of the SVM. Defaults to `0.001`
- `gamma`: This defines the "spread" of gaussian kernels. The larger the `gamma` value, the tighter the hyperplane will wrap positive values. Defaults to `0.1`

## About
Basic information regarding support vector machines and this library

### What is a SVM?
A support vector machine is a machine learning tool used primarily for binary classification and regression. It is a "supervised" machine learning technique, meaning the SVM requires training data to base classifications on. In many cases, a SVM is a more accurate classifier than an artificial neural network.

### SMO
SMO, or sequential minimal optimization, is an algorithm for solving SVMs devised by John C. Platt. The original research paper is linked in the [sources](#sources) section. __This library utilizes the SMO algorithm for training SVMs.__ The SMO algorithm was chosen because it is less memory intensive and requires less computing power than other SVM algorithms.
